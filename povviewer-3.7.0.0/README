	Compile and install.
	--------------------

	for compile can be used codeblocks
		povviewer.cbp - is project file
		makefile also added

	1.  compile povdump as povray

				./configure COMPILED_BY=...
			other options set as povray settings on your machine --prefix=/usr or /usr/local etc

				make
			and then don't make install, just copy povray binary in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin or
			another folder where povdump will be accessible via $PATH

	2.  compile povviewer
			place povviewer binary in PATH directory or not

	for testing
		cd povviewer/scenes
		povviewer test.pov
	or
		bin/Debug/povviewer test.pov



	Usage.
	------

	simple to run:
		povviewer my_scene.pov

	- povdump must be accessible via PATH, i place it in /usr/local/bin/ on my slackware
	- also needed /dev/shm for store scene dump
	  add this line to your /etc/fstab
	    tmpfs  /dev/shm  tmpfs  defaults  0  0

	in any case you can change sources to adapt povviewer to you system



	Interface.
	----------

	some info writed in stdout console (in debug version)

	in window title:
		pt - parse time
		lt - load time

	total time to show scene is pt + lt

	on screen texts:
		spd - speed of movement camera (just for debug)
		pos - position of camera
		up/fup - camera up vector (f mean fixed)
		lat - look at (navigator position)
		angle (persp/ortho) - fov angle for perspective camera or some zoom for ortho camera
		fps - is a fps (frame per second)

	navigator - simple shape as diamond colored as RGB - XYZ



	Hot keys.
	---------

	ESC - quit

	modifiers:
		default mod = 1
		CTRL  - mod = 0.1
		ALT   - mod = mod * 100
		SHIFT - mod = mod * 0.01
	mod affect on all actions which increase or decrease any parameters

	LMB + motion - rotate camera around position
	MMB + motion - rotate camera around navigator

	MOUSE WHEEL - zoom camera

	w,s,a,d,r,f - camera movement
	q,e - rotate camera around direction if up vector is not fixed
	CURSOR UP/DOWN - move navigator forward/backward
	PAGEUP/PAGEDOWN - change navigator size

	SPACE - toggle show navigator

	F1  - show/hide bounding boxes
	F2  - show/hide dots
	F3  - show/hide lines
	F4  - show/hide faces
	F5  - reload scene
	F6  - toggle smooth normals and reload scene
	F7  - show/hide povray camera
	F12 - show/hide normals
	BACKSPACE - toggle antialias

	p - "take screenshot" (run povray with current camera position)
	x,y,z - toggle axis visibility
	u - toggle setup camera as povray scene camera on load scene

	KEYPAD0 - set camera to povray scene camera position
	KEYPAD1 - set camera to ortho and front view
	KEYPAD3 - set camera to ortho and right view
	KEYPAD5 - toggle camera ortho/perspective
	KEYPAD7 - set camera to ortho and up view
	KEYPAD* - toggle fixation of camera up vector
	KEYPAD+/KEYPAD- - increase/decrease scene clock and reload scene

	RMB - aim camera to nearest object center

	F11 - toggle stereo mode on/off
	n,m - increase/decrease distance beetween eyes, in stereo mode

	v,b - make background darker/lighter
	c - reset background to default


	How to change parameters.
	-------------------------

	In main scene file you can place some directives. Its important, in file which name is given
	to povviewer as parameter. Not in included files.

		povviewer main_scene_file.pov

	This file scanned before every time when scene parsed with povdump and scene dump is loaded
	into povviewer.

	Place at begin of line needed directive. Syntax is:

		// povviewer:window_height=384
		// povviewer:window_width=512

	There is parameters list with example values:

		window_width=512
		window_height=512
		cam_zfar=100000
		cam_znear=0.001
		bgcolor=0.847059,0.784314,0.752941
		location=0,0,-9
		direction=0,0,1
		up=0,1,0
		fixed_up=0,1,0
		right=-1,0,0
		angle=90
		ortho_size=6.35
		distance_to_nav=9
		up_fixed=1
		max_speed=10
		delta_speed=0.01
		delta_rotation=0.005
		perspective=0
		antialias=0
		show_navigator=1
		navigator_size=0.04
		show_axis=1,1,0
		axis_size=1000
		stereo_cam=0
		stereo_base_size=0.04
		font=-monotype-andale mono-medium-r-normal--10-0-0-0-c-0-iso8859-1

		isoresolution=32,32,32
		quadresolution=32,32,32
		blobresolution=64,64,64
		patchresolution=4
		cone_num_latitudes=3
		cone_num_longitudes=16
		sphere_num_latitudes=8
		sphere_num_longitudes=16
		lathe_num_longitudes=16
		lathe_spline_steps=8
		prism_spline_steps=8
		plane_radius=100
		plane_step=10
		torus_usteps=16
		torus_vsteps=8
		disc_usteps=16
		disc_vsteps=8
		max_lights=8
		normals_size=0.5
		objects_quality=9
		scene_clock=0
		use_povray_camera=1
		show_bbox=0
		show_dots=0
		show_lines=1
		show_solid=1
		show_normals=0
		show_planes=0
		smooth_obj=1
		smooth_angle=45
		plane_alpha=0.15
		show_camera=1
		frustum_size=50

	Also there is some extra directives without parameters:

		used as:
			// povviewer:save
			// povviewer:end

		save - new parameters will be saved into config files on exit povviewer
		nosave - don't save parameters
		reset - reset all parameters to default values (as in sources)
		end - stop scanning file for parameter changes, placed as last directive. Without this
			povviewer will scan entire given scene file. Place this parameter - and povviewer
			will stop scan. Useful with big scene file.
